# Chaos-Game
This program will render a 2D histogram of the chaos game with your cpu and output to a png image in the same folder.

# Renders
Check out the renders folder for some existing renders I've done on my computer.

# CLI
The argument parser I made does not work, I have just been changing the defaults in the source and recompiling it :/
