# Chaos-Game
This program will render a 2D histogram of the chaos game with your cpu and output to a png image in the same folder.

# Renders
Check out the renders folder for some existing renders I've done on my computer.

# CLI Arguments
Set the number of polygon sides (1 for a circle): -n 3
Set the output image resolution (the image is always square, so only 1 number): -size 512
Set the iterations per pixel multiplier to make it look better: -mul 256
